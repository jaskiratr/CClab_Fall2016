# Midterm Brief

## Presentations on 25th October 2016
### Time limit: 7 min sharp !

#### Design and develop a project that addresses approaches/highlights/solves a problem/issue/concern of a user/environment/community. This really give's you a lot of freedom to shape your ideas into defined designs.

When develop your prototype, answer these key questions:

- Who is your intended user? Define the environment, activities, interactions, objects  and the users
- What pain-point or problem exists? Define your problem statement
-  What is your idea and how does it address that issue? Define your design and what is the intent behind it. How is your proposal better than what is out there... (Do you research)

 **Note:** Feel free to combine this project with another class. If you do so, make sure you disclose that. In such cases, you are usually expected to put in twice the effort than otherwise you would have.

### Submission format:
- Upload the code on Github
- Make a readme.md file (name it EXACTLY THIS) in the midterm folder
- Add notes about your concept, research and development process in it.
- Add the video link to the documentation in it.

### You will be evaluated on :

**Concept** : Has the student developed a cogent concept that manifests itself in a demonstrable form and evidences a
significant contribution in its domain?

**Communication** : How well is the student able to express the ideas about their project, goals and process? This includes
verbal, written and diagrammatic forms of communication such as drawing, mapping, modeling and previsualizing.

**Critical Thinking and Reflective Judgment** : To what degree has the student demonstrated and developed critical thinking skills? Reflective judgment
not only asks the questions with concrete answers such as evaluative questions about form, methodology,
materials, utility, ergonomics, aesthetics, style, cultural, experience, research, and process critique, but also
attacks difficult problems of the world that require research and evidence to support conclusions that can
then be offered to the fields encompassed by design and technology.

**Creative Process** : Is the student incorporating a form- and project-appropriate methodology to their work? Can the student
evaluate how procedural decisions impact their projectsâ€™ successes and failures? Creative process may
include problem identification, brainstorming, generating ideas, analysis, research, writing of specifications
and constraints, real-world costs, feasibility, testing, iterating along a line of thinking and then approaching
the problem differently in the next cycle, evaluation of process and evaluation of the form created,
integrating and adapting new processes and ideas along the iterative design cycle.

**Contextualization** : Has the student been able to connect their work and ideas to historical and contemporary precedents, and to
situate their work within the larger discourse surrounding ideas of design and technology?
Integration and Appropriate Use of Technology
Is the student making good choices about the form and type of technology they are using to express their
design concepts?

**Aesthetics & Presentation** : Are students able to present the core concepts and experience of their project in an appropriate
presentable form?
